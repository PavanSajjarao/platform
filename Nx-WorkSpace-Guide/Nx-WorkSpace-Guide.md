# NX Workspace: In-Depth Guide

## 1. What is NX Workspace?
NX is a **monorepo** build system and development tool for managing multiple applications and libraries within a single repository. It is particularly useful for enterprise-level applications and large-scale projects.

### üóÇÔ∏è Core Concept: Monorepo
- **Monorepo** ("Mono" = single, "Repo" = repository) allows multiple apps and libraries to coexist in a unified codebase.
- **Example:** You have a `rest-api`, `data-api`, and a shared `auth-lib`. Instead of maintaining them in separate repositories, NX allows you to manage them in one place.

## 2. NX Workspace Structure

```
my-nx-workspace/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps/          # Contains main applications
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rest-api/  # REST API service
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data-api/  # Data-related service
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ libs/          # Shared libraries
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth-lib/  # Authentication logic
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/     # Utility functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nx.json        # NX configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workspace.json # Project task definitions
```

- **`apps/`**: Main applications (e.g., APIs, frontend apps).
- **`libs/`**: Reusable libraries (e.g., authentication, logging).
- **`nx.json`**: NX's core configuration (caching, task dependencies).
- **`workspace.json`**: Defines how tasks (build, lint, test) are run.

## 3. NX Workflow: How It Works

### üõ†Ô∏è Development Flow

1. **Create an NX Workspace:**
   ```bash
   npx create-nx-workspace@latest my-nx-workspace
   ```

2. **Add Applications and Libraries:**
   ```bash
   nx generate @nx/node:application rest-api
   nx generate @nx/node:library auth-lib
   ```

3. **Run and Test:**
   ```bash
   nx serve rest-api
   nx test auth-lib
   ```

4. **Build Efficiently:**
   ```bash
   nx build rest-api
   ```

### üîÑ Dependency Graph (Dependency Map)

A **Dependency Graph** is a visual map showing how different parts of the system depend on each other. NX automatically tracks these dependencies.

For example:

```
rest-api --> auth-lib --> utils
```

Run this command to visualize:
```bash
nx graph
```

üëâ **Why is this useful?**
- Helps identify which parts of your code rely on others.
- Speeds up builds by only running tasks for affected projects.

**Dependency Graph Flow:**

```plaintext
 +-------------+       +---------+       +-------+
 | rest-api    +------>+ auth-lib+------>+ utils |
 +-------------+       +---------+       +-------+
```

If you change `utils`, NX knows it affects everything downstream and rebuilds only what is necessary.

### üìå What is a Task Pipeline?
A **Task Pipeline** is a sequence of tasks that need to be executed in a specific order. For instance:

1. Build the library
2. Run tests
3. Deploy the application

In NX, you can configure these pipelines using the `targetDependencies` field in `nx.json`.

**Task Pipeline Flow:**

```plaintext
 +--------+     +-------+     +---------+
 | Build  +---->+ Test  +---->+ Deploy  |
 +--------+     +-------+     +---------+
```

üëâ **Why is this useful?**
- Ensures tasks are performed in the correct order.
- Automates repetitive processes.
